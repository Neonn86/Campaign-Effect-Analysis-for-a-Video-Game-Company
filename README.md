# Online Campaign Effect Analysis for a Video Game Company
## Objective
Online communities are perceived as a way to increase user engagement in video games. 

The goal is to examine the effect of the online community by statistically evaluating its impact on metrics such as **revenue, retention and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).**

## Data
-  Users' spending before and after the introduction of the online community.
-  Users' age at the time of the introduction.
-  Users' average spend 3 months after the introduction.
-  Users' churn status 3 months after the introduction.
-  Users' acquisition channel.

## Structure

## Conclusion
-  Although the user spend increased by $29 in the short term, there was a significant uptick in churn which ultimately resulted in no significant difference in CLV among the joined users.
-   The method of customer acquisition has no statistically significant impact on churn and also other predictors.
